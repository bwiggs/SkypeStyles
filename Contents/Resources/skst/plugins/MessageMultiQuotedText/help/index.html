	To input quotes into your messages use the &gt; sign followed by a space.
	For the multilevel just use &gt;&gt; followed by a space, or &gt;&gt;&gt; and so on.

	Example:
</p>
<p class="example">
	&gt; one
	<br/>
	&gt;&gt; two
	<br/>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; three
</p>
<p>
	PS: This plugin is useful when you paste some text emails with replies where
	the lines are heading with one or more "&gt;" looking at the level of the reply.
	It'll make it easier to read this kind of copy/paste.
	<br/>
	It's also useful while using Skype context menu "Quote message" on a previous
	message in the chat.
