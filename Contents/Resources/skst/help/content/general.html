<!-- Genereal help (NOTHING ABOUT ANY PLUGIN IN HERE!) -->
<h2>Looking for help?</h2>
<p>
	Looking how to use the skin? And be aware of all the little stuff hidden
	under the hood?
	<br/>
	This is the place to be!
</p>
<p>
	All extra features of this skin have been added on top of the basic Skype
	skin that hasn't been touched.
</p>
<p>
	This allows us to have each extra feature coded as a plugin and making the
	general architecture clean and flexible.
</p>
<p>
	You can find a complete list of every plugin (synthax highlighter,
	quoted message systemâ€¦) present on the skin using the drop down box.
</p>
<p>
	Soon, a complete documentation of the system wil be made, allowing people to
	make their own plugins on top of the system.
</p>
<p>
	Any questions? Request? Problem? We have a
	<a href="http://bugs.skypestyles.com/">bug tracker</a> or you can send us an
	<a href="mailto:skypestyles@gmail.com">email</a>.
